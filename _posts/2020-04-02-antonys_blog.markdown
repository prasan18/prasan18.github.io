I completed my diploma in Automobile Engineering in India and started working in Automobile Industry .When my visa was approved to come to USA ,I was offered a job in Automobile industry, Where I had to start my career from the scratch.

So,I decided to change my career path for the upliftment of my family and I did some research and joined career karma. Through them I got selected to Flatiron Coding Academy to start my software Engineering (part time).
